Advent of Code solutions

2021 is the second year that I coded along to Advent of Code in real-time during the month of December, and the first year that I am making my code available. The solutions have been tested but not refined or edited beyond getting them functioning successfully on tests and input. All solutions are in python. 

Solutions to days 1-7 are included in the week 1 file. Solutions to days 8-15 are included in the week 2 file. The days 16 and after are not currently included because I became rather distracted by a family visit at the time, but I hope to come back and include those solutions later. Out of the problems that I completed for 2021, days 4, 8, and 10 were especially fun.

Specifications and instructions for running the code are provided in the script docstrings, but in general, call the code from the command line like so:

python 2021_AoC_Wk1.py day4_2 input_4.txt    

Two sample input files were included but if you want to run the other solutions or view the problem statements, visit [the Advent of Code website](https://adventofcode.com/2021).  Many thanks to the AoC team for the fun times!
